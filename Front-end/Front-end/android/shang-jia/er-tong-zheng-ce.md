Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Prevention Standards
To ensure our platform provides a safe and healthy environment for all users, we have implemented the following measures to prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE):
1.Strict Content Moderation
We use a combination of advanced automated tools and manual review to screen all user-generated content, especially images, videos, and text. Any content related to child sexual abuse, exploitation, or other illegal material will be filtered out and removed.
1.User Behavior Monitoring
We monitor user behavior to detect and prevent any activities that may involve child sexual abuse or exploitation. Any suspicious behavior will be reported immediately to our safety team for further investigation.
1.Reporting and Feedback Mechanism
Users can report any suspected child sexual abuse or exploitation through the in-app reporting feature. We encourage all users to help create a safe and healthy community. Reports will be processed promptly, and if necessary, the case will be referred to the appropriate legal authorities.
1.Education and Training
We regularly provide training on child protection and CSAE prevention for our staff and content moderation teams to ensure they are equipped to identify and respond to potential risks.
1.Privacy Protection and Data Security
We strictly adhere to data protection regulations, especially when it comes to the privacy of children. Any personal information collected is solely used for identity verification purposes and will not be shared or used for inappropriate purposes.
1.Collaboration
 with Relevant Authorities
We collaborate with child protection organizations, law enforcement agencies, and industry standard-setting bodies worldwide to help ensure the security and integrity of our platform.

How to Report Inappropriate Content?
If you encounter any content that may involve child sexual abuse or exploitation, or if you have any concerns, please use the in-app reporting feature to contact us. We are committed to handling each report promptly and professionally.
