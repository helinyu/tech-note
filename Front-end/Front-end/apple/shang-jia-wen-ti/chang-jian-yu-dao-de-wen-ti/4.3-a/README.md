Guideline 4.3(a) - Design - Spam

We noticed your app shares a similar binary, metadata, and/or concept as apps submitted to the App Store by other developers, with only minor differences.

Submitting similar or repackaged apps is a form of spam that creates clutter and makes it difficult for users to discover new apps.

Next Steps

Since we do not accept spam apps on the App Store, we encourage you to review your app concept and submit a unique app with distinct content and functionality.

Resources

Some factors that contribute to a spam rejection may include:

* Submitting an app with the same source code or assets as other apps already submitted to the App Store
* Creating and submitting multiple similar apps using a repackaged app template
* Purchasing an app template with problematic code from a third party
* Submitting several similar apps across multiple accounts
