# EBCDIC

EBCDIC（Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code）即扩展二进制编码的十进制交换码。

**特点**：

1. 历史悠久：主要由IBM开发，在大型机系统中曾经广泛使用。
2. 编码方式：和常见的 ASCII 编码不同，EBCDIC 使用8位来表示一个字符。它有多种不同的字符集变体，包含了字母、数字、标点符号和控制字符等。

**与 ASCII 的区别**：

* ASCII 编码使用7位或8位表示一个字符，且字符集相对较为简单。EBCDIC 的字符集更为复杂，包含的字符数量更多，并且编码方式与 ASCII 完全不同。

随着时间的推移，ASCII 和后来的 Unicode 编码在大多数现代计算环境中更为普遍，而 EBCDIC 主要在一些遗留的大型机系统中继续存在。

这个代码大概是使用了ASCII编码的方式， aiClass在词法分析器中有重要作用
static const unsigned char aiClass[] = {
